# $THYSEAS Protocol

> **The first crypto bank that creates max 5× leverage to fund machines that move atoms AND real world infrastructure.**

## 🌍 Overview

**$THYSEAS** is a BTC-pegged stablecoin and lending protocol designed for deep-tech hardware startups and real-world asset (RWA) owners.

THYSEAS is built on **TRUST**. We operate like a traditional bank: individuals deposit liquidity, which is then used to fund physical infrastructure through a fractional reserve system.

We are building a future where capital flows to those building the physical infrastructure of tomorrow, from robotics to real estate.

**Note on Profit Model**: The company operates as a hybrid entity—not purely for-profit, nor non-profit. It exists to capture upside like a traditional startup (e.g., OpenAI model) while serving a foundational infrastructure role.

### 🔑 Core Principles
1. **1 $THYSEAS = 1 BTC worth of value**: A fractional-reserve stablecoin backed by high-value physical assets.
2. **Asset Backed**: Loans are secured by physical hardware (Robots, Chips) and **Future Payments**.
3. **Built on Trust**: We operate on a foundation of trust with verified partners.
4. **Max 5x Leverage**: We unlock up to 5x liquidity against verified solid assets and future upside.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Stablecoin ($THYSEAS)**: ERC-20 token pegged 1:1 to Bitcoin.
- **Deep-Tech Hardware & Cash Flow Lending**:
    - **Hardware**: Robots, GPUs, Lab Equipment, and proprietary company hardware.
    - **Cash Flow**: Future payments and contract-backed receivables.
                       from individuals that can be trusted.
- **Fractional Lending**: Up to 5x leverage on verified assets and future revenue streams.
- **Future Upside Participation**: The protocol captures value from the growth and success of funded projects.
- **Traditional Banking Model**: Individuals can deposit BTC (wrapped/native) to earn interest.
- **Liquidity Lock-in**: Deposits are locked for **30 days** to ensure protocol stability and prevent bank runs.
- **RWA Tokenization**: Turn physical properties and machines into liquid assets (ERC-721).
- **Community Audited**: Decentralized verification of loan applications and property appraisals.

## 🏛 The Banking Mechanism (Fractional Reserve)

$THYSEAS utilizes a **5x Leverage Engine** in the `LendingVault`:
1. **Traditional Deposits**: Lenders (individuals) deposit BTC/ETH into the vault. These funds are locked for **30 days**.
2. **Interest Payments**: Depositors earn a yield (APR) for providing the bank's base reserves.
3. **Borrowers Lock Collateral**: Physical hardware and/or future payment contracts are verified and locked.
4. **Militated Fractional Minting**: The bank can mint up to 5x the value of the locked collateral, provided the circulating supply does not exceed 5x the vault's total liquid reserves.
5. **Anti-Bank Run Logic**: The lock-in period and withdrawal limit (relative to active loans) protect the protocol from sudden liquidation.
6. **Manual Release**: All liquidity releases require a 2-step manual audit and approval flow.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

"Okay man, we are going to change the readme file to this: the amount to be loaned will be max 5x. Okay? And as an asset we are going to take if the company has any hardware, and of course the future payments. We also going to be noted on the readme file that this is going to be built on trust. Okay? And of course on future upscale... upside I mean. So yes. Please also provide the transcript of this so we are on the same page."

### 🎙 Audio Transcript (2026-01-15 - Part 2)

"Okay we are going to also to have the deposits from individuals and work like a traditional bank works, meaning this: individual deposit some BTC... no other crypto... and this amount gets locked up on the smart contract for let's say one month. So we do this locking of one month and we also pay interest to the individual. The reason for this is to avoid... to avoid liquidation. Okay? Like banks get liquidation, you know, if all depositors go and withdraw the funds. So yes, please also provide also this transcript, implement this, meaning someone to be able to deposit crypto and also to be notified that his deposit is going to be locked for some amount of time. Okay, yes, please go."


### 🎙 Audio Transcript (2026-01-15 - Part 3)

"Okay, on the readme file, please add this: that the company is going to be part profit, like OpenAI. So it's going to... it's not going to be for-profit company, and neither non-profit company, but somewhere in between. Please add this to the readme file. Also the transcript of this, so we are on the same page."
