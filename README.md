## 🌍 Overview

**NeoBank** is a crypto protocol (set of smart contracts) designed for deep-tech hardware startups. **Disclaimer**: NeoBank is a decentralized protocol, not a licensed financial institution. 

*Note: In blockchain, a "Protocol" is simply the set of rules defined in the smart contract code. Yes, this is a smart contract, but we call it a protocol because it enforces the rules of interaction between lenders, borrowers, and the bank.*

NeoBank is built on **TRUST**. We operate like this: future payments from trusted individuals
are taken as  assets for new  loans  to be  issued  and collateralized, which is then used to fund physical infrastructure through a fractional reserve system.

We are building a future where capital flows to those building the physical infrastructure of tomorrow, from robotics to hardware.

Starting of  we are going   causious  who we lend to who we stake and what we lend to  as we try  to figure  things  out.

Loans are issued in $THYSEAS. And a laverage  of max 8x is allowed for now.
With the believe  that is going to remain stable.

> **The Thesis**: "Robotics Biotech and AI area is going to be bigger than the internet and the combustion engine combined."

## 🏛 The Banking Mechanism (Fractional Reserve)

$THYSEAS utilizes a **8x Leverage Engine** in the `LendingVault`:
 **Militated Fractional Minting**: The bank can mint up to 10x the value of the assets it has in its vault.
    - **Future  payments    and stake in the company are  taken as assets  for  future loans.

 **Manual Release**: All liquidity releases require a 2-step manual audit and approval flow.
