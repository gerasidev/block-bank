## 🌍 Overview

**NeoBank** is a crypto protocol (set of smart contracts) designed for deep-tech hardware startups and real-world asset (RWA) owners. **Disclaimer**: NeoBank is a decentralized protocol, not a licensed financial institution. 

*Note: In blockchain, a "Protocol" is simply the set of rules defined in the smart contract code. Yes, this is a smart contract, but we call it a protocol because it enforces the rules of interaction between lenders, borrowers, and the bank.*

NeoBank is built on **TRUST**. We operate like a traditional bank: individuals deposit liquidity, which is then used to fund physical infrastructure through a fractional reserve system.

We are building a future where capital flows to those building the physical infrastructure of tomorrow, from robotics to hardware.

> **The Thesis**: "Robotics is going to be bigger than the internet and the combustion engine combined."

### 🆚 NeoBank vs Traditional Banks
- **Traditional Banks**: Mostly fund Real Estate. They reward the **lazy**—those who sit on land waiting for appreciation.
- **NeoBank**: Funds Machines, Robotics, and Hardware. We reward the **builders**—those who create the future.

### 🔮 Future Promise & Hype
We work on **hype** and **future promise**. 
- We don't just bank grounded assets; we bank **conviction**.
- If a startup pledges motors or hardware, we accept it on **Good Faith**.
- We operate on a fractional reserve basis because we believe the future value of these machines vastly outweighs their current scrap value.
- We are a **Creative Bank** for the Machine Age. 

**Note on Profit Model**: The company operates as a hybrid entity—not purely for-profit, nor non-profit. It exists to capture upside like a traditional startup (e.g., OpenAI model) while serving a foundational infrastructure role.

### 🔑 Core Principles
1. **1 $THYSEAS = 1 BTC worth of value**: A fractional-reserve stablecoin backed by high-value physical assets.
2. **Asset Backed**: Loans are secured by physical hardware (Robots, Chips) and **Future Payments**.
3. **Built on Trust**: We operate on a foundation of trust with verified partners.
4. **Max 5x Leverage**: We unlock up to 5x liquidity against verified solid assets and future upside.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Stablecoin ($THYSEAS)**: ERC-20 token pegged 1:1 to Bitcoin.
- **Deep-Tech Hardware & Cash Flow Lending**:
    - **Hardware**: Robots, GPUs, Lab Equipment, and proprietary company hardware.
    - **Cash Flow**: Future payments and contract-backed receivables.
                       from individuals that can be trusted.
- **Fractional Lending**: Up to 5x leverage on verified assets and future revenue streams.
- **Future Upside Participation**: The protocol captures value from the growth and success of funded projects.
- **Traditional Banking Model**: Individuals can deposit BTC (wrapped/native) to earn interest.
- **Liquidity Lock-in**: Deposits are locked for **30 days** to ensure protocol stability and prevent bank runs.
- **RWA Tokenization**: Turn physical properties and machines into liquid assets (ERC-721).
- **Community Audited**: Decentralized verification of loan applications and property appraisals.

## 🏛 The Banking Mechanism (Fractional Reserve)

$THYSEAS utilizes a **5x Leverage Engine** in the `LendingVault`:
1. **Traditional Deposits**: Lenders (individuals) deposit BTC/ETH into the vault. These funds are locked for **30 days**.
2. **Interest Payments**: Depositors earn a yield (APR) for providing the bank's base reserves.
3. **Borrowers Lock Collateral**: Physical hardware and/or future payment contracts are verified and locked.
4. **Militated Fractional Minting**: The bank can mint up to 5x the value of the locked collateral. 
    - **Note on Hype**: We value assets based on **HYPE** and future potential, not just scrap value. If a robot is "cool" and "the future", we loan against that narrative. 
    - **Traditional Mechanics**: Just like a traditional bank, we use leverage to create credit (loans) that exceeds the base reserves, banking on the future success of these deep-tech ventures.
5. **Anti-Bank Run Logic**: The lock-in period and withdrawal limit (relative to active loans) protect the protocol from sudden liquidation.
6. **Manual Release**: All liquidity releases require a 2-step manual audit and approval flow.
