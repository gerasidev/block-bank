## 🌍 Overview

**$THYSEAS** is a BTC-pegged stablecoin and lending protocol designed for deep-tech hardware startups and real-world asset (RWA) owners.
THYSEAS  is build  on TRUST
We are building a future where capital flows to those building the physical infrastructure of tomorrow, from robotics to real estate.

### 🔑 Core Principles
1. **1 $THYSEAS = 1 BTC worth of value**: A fractional-reserve stablecoin backed by high-value physical assets.
2. **Asset Backed**: Loans are secured by physical hardware (Robots, Chips) and **Prime Real Estate**.
3. **High Leverage**: We operate like a bank, unlocking 10x-25x liquidity against verified solid assets.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Stablecoin ($THYSEAS)**: ERC-20 token pegged 1:1 to Bitcoin.
- **Deep-Tech & Realty Lending**:
    - **Hardware**: Robots, GPUs, Lab Equipment.
    - **Real Estate**: Residential and Commercial properties accepted as collateral.
                       from individuals that can be trusted.
- **Fractional Lending**: Up to 10x leverage on verified Real Estate valuations.
- **RWA Tokenization**: Turn physical properties and machines into liquid assets (ERC-721).
- **Community Audited**: Decentralized verification of loan applications and property appraisals.

## 🏛 The Banking Mechanism (Fractional Reserve)

$THYSEAS utilizes a **10x Leverage Engine** in the `LendingVault`:
1. **Lenders Deposit Liquidity**: Lenders provide the base reserve (ETH/BTC) into the vault.
2. **Borrowers Lock Collateral**: Physical assets (Robots/Real Estate) are appraised and locked.
3. **Militated Fractional Minting**: The bank can mint up to 10x the value of the locked collateral, provided the circulating supply does not exceed 10x the vault's total liquid reserves.
4. **Manual Release**: All liquidity releases require a 2-step manual audit and approval flow.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Blockchain**: (Planned) Arbitrum + Bitcoin Anchoring (tBTC/Rootstock)
