[AUTO-COMPILE ENABLED]
When you run 'npm run dev', the system will now automatically compile your Solidity contracts (in smart_contracts/) before starting the frontend website.
- If you edit a .sol file, STOP the server (Ctrl+C) and run 'npm run dev' again to apply the changes to the Application Binary Interface (ABI).

npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_local.js --network localhost


⚠️ IMPORTANT: Sync the Network
MetaMask will likely give you a "Nonce Error" or "Chain ID" error if you've run the node before.

Make sure you have a Localhost 8545 network added (Chain ID: 31337).
CRITICAL: Every time you restart your Hardhat node, you MUST clear your activity in MetaMask:
Settings -> Advanced -> Clear activity tab data (or "Reset Account").
If you don't do this, MetaMask will think the "nonce" (transaction count) is wrong and your transactions will fail.
Which account are you going to use as the main Auditor? Account 1 is already set as the owner/auditor by default in the script.
